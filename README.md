# School Alarm

A very basic automated alaram designed for a school. 
This was done while I was an intern at KTechnics Systems.
The program uses up most of the memory available on the Uno. This is due to the inefficient use of arrays among other .... inefficiencies. 

``` Any help improving the program would be highly appreciated.```
